# Learning-zig

The repository contains multiple files each showcasing a different aspect of the Zig language. As I progress through my learning journey, I'll continue to add more complex examples.

## Getting Started

To run these examples on your own machine, you'll need to have Zig installed. You can download Zig from the [official Zig programming language download page](https://ziglang.org/download/).

After installing Zig, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/zig-learning-project.git
